# Arkanoid Game Project

Welcome to my Arkanoid game project!  
This game was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course and serves as a demonstration of OOP principles and a variety of design patterns.

## Overview

Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaker game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy blocks on the screen. This implementation features:

- **Three unique levels** with different designs and challenges
- **Rich use of design patterns** to structure the code and gameplay
- **Clean, modular architecture** for easy expansion and maintenance
- **Score tracking and Game Over screen**

## Screenshots

Below are screenshots from the game, showcasing the three levels and the game over screen:

### Level 1: "Yam Pam Puz"

- Features a target and concentric circles for aiming practice.
- Focuses on precision and control.

### Level 2: "Mid Level"

- Features a bright sun effect and varied block placement.
- Encourages strategic block breaking and maneuvering.

### Level 3: "You Can't Win Here"

- Classic brick wall layout with special blocks ("add ball", "deadblock").
- Includes obstacles and increased difficulty.

### Game Over Screen

- Displays your final score and prompts you to close the game.

## Design Patterns Used

This project is a showcase of several design patterns, including:

- **Singleton:** Managing resources like the game engine or score tracker.
- **Factory:** Creating different types of levels and blocks.
- **Observer:** Updating score and game state when events occur.
- **Strategy:** Handling different ball movement algorithms.
- **Command:** Processing user input and game actions.
- **State:** Managing level transitions and game over logic.
- **Decorator/Composite:** For complex block behaviors.

## How to Play

- Use your keyboard to control the paddle and bounce the ball.
- Clear all blocks to advance to the next level.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible!
- When the game is over, press space to exit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Java (or the required runtime environment).
3. cd Arkanoid
4. ant run
